# Overview
The Contact Manager App is an Android application that allows users to manage their contacts (add, delete). It stores contact details such as name, phone number and email using Room, a database library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.

This app demonstrates how to use Room for local data storage and integrates it with Jetpack Compose for building modern Android UIs.

# Features

View Contacts: All stored contacts are displayed in an alphabetically ordered list.

Delete Contacts: Remove contacts from the list.
